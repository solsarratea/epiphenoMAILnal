----------------> EPISODE 8: Rite of passage <-----------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

  Assuming you've been initialized with email.
     We are going to start with [*]epiphenoMAILnal: ritual of emails.
The meaning of the word comes from merging epiphenomenon & mail. Douglas Hofstadter defines it as a large-scale illusion created by the collusion of many small and indisputably non-illusory events. Inspired by the "Ode to a box of Envelopes" by Jeannil King:


Reciting the "Ode to an inbox of emails":
    (GODMAIL SERVER IS ALIVE)
     An inbox of mails on the web
I want to shift them to my protocol
I squeeze the client side, there’s something declared!
In web worldwide, there’s thoughts to be shared
I squeeze again, and ritualize.
Is this the ritual of my mind?
Determined now, and all at once,
checkout the mailbox, still have time !
For browser’s view of preach, I combust
shortcuts quotes that will last
In zips? Or mail forty-six?
My ritual, wormhole, may do exist.

So mails travel all around
As I wait, for the time to round up
my ritual’s repost, and in my core
could there be, perhaps, something to store?
For more than parts, this goal was known
New form of art was born
In parts, the rituals’ witness box
In fact, I think, I’ll use firefox.
